 This is the assets repository for [Enterprise Architecture Transformation: Merged/Split Company project](https://lnkd.in/eub_MbB3), published on Linkedin.

## What is this project about?
As Lead Solution Architect/Enterprise Architect, I spearheaded the integration efforts of a company formed from the merger of three distinct entities.
The project tasks were structured to achieve these objectives:
1. Separation of Business Models
2. Decomposition by Architecture Levels
3. Transformation to a Service-Oriented Model
4. Development of a Transformation Roadmap
5. Prioritized Transformation
Actions Taken
The following actions were implemented to drive the transformation:
1. Integrated TOGAF and Agile Frameworks
2. Architectural Assessment
3. Model Identification
4. Full-Cycle Architectural Projects
Parallel execution of these actions aimed to reduce overall time to achieve results and begin subproject delivery, ultimately transforming related business functionality.
## Instructions and Navigations
This example demonstrates how to integrate existing infrastructure into an Enterprise Architecture Model that is currently in its initial stages of development. The approach aims to identify gaps in the current architecture and standardization processes, providing opportunities to address these issues using a short-cycle TOGAF/ADM framework.
